In baseball, a team can provide a departing free agent player with a qualifying offer1: a one-year contract whose monetary value is the average of the 125 highest salaries from the past season. The player is free to reject it and sign with any other team, but his new team will have to forfeit a draft pick.

Use the "generate" button to access the a player annual salary API to find the 125 highest salaries of the past season and deduce the average to make an offer.
